/**
    Base class for a musical device that can play sounds.

    To create a BKSynthesiser, you'll need to create a subclass of BKSynthesiserSound
    to describe each sound available to your mainSynth, and a subclass of  juce::BKSamplerVoice
    which can play back one of these sounds.

    Then you can use the addVoice() and addSound() methods to give the BKSynthesiser a
    set of sounds, and a set of voices it can use to play them. If you only give it
    one voice it will be monophonic - the more voices it has, the more polyphony it'll
    have available.

    Then repeatedly call the renderNextBlock() method to produce the audio. Any midi
    events that go in will be scanned for note on/off messages, and these are used to
    start and stop the voices playing the appropriate sounds.

    While it's playing, you can also cause notes to be triggered by calling the noteOn(),
    noteOff() and other controller methods.

    Before rendering, be sure to call the setCurrentPlaybackSampleRate() to tell it
    what the target playback rate is. This value is passed on to the voices so that
    they can pitch their output correctly.
